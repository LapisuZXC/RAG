Usually there's some positions in the game where it's like, you have it or you don't in the position, and I feel like sometimes he's tasks with learning difficult roles. But I consider him a very versatile player, and he's very keen to learn and study his spots. I put a lot of faith in him to make adjustments. But yeah, I don't think anything has been an issue lately.

There are some maps where I am slightly more supportive, I obviously don't want to limit ultimate and his movement, especially if he has an AWP on T Inferno.

I don't think it's a mental hurdle, I just think we are a new team. NertZ has a completely different skillset than YEKINDAR, so it is an adjustment period.
